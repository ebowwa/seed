# Cost Analysis Scenarios
analysis_scenarios:
  persistent_agents_per_server:
    description: "If each agent = 1 dedicated server 24/7"
    findings:
      free_tier_loss: "€98.70/month per user (30 × €3.29)"
      max_tier_loss: "€982.01/month per user (300 × €3.29 - €4.99)"
      ultra_tier_loss: "€9,825/month per user (3,000 × €3.29 - €45)"
    conclusion: "Completely unsustainable model"

  time_sharing_model:
    description: "Pooling resources where agents share compute time"
    calculations:
      max_plan_budget: "€4.99 = ~950 hours of compute"
      agents_share: "300 agents ÷ 950 hours = ~3.2 hours per agent per month"
      daily_usage: "~6 minutes per day per agent"
    conclusion: "More plausible but misleading marketing"

  dynamic_provisioning_model:
    description: "Spin up/delete servers on-demand, billed per minute"
    assumptions:
      average_session: "30-60 minutes per agent task"
      cost_per_session: "€0.0026-0.006 (essentially negligible)"
      typical_usage: "Most users won't utilize full quota"
    profit_calculation:
      max_plan_example:
        budget: "€4.99/month = 950 hours compute"
        if_150h_used: "150 × €0.0052 = €0.78 cost"
        profit_margin: "84% (€4.21 profit per user)"
    conclusion: "Most likely business model"

# Realistic Cost Examples
usage_examples:
  "30 minute coding session": "€0.0026 (cax11) to €0.0036 (cpx11)"
  "1 hour debugging": "€0.0052 to €0.0072"
  "8 hour workday": "€0.04 to €0.06"
  "24 hour continuous": "€0.12 to €0.17"

# Business Model Insights
business_model:
  marketing_vs_reality:
    perceived: "300 persistent agents running simultaneously"
    actual: "300 agent launches totaling ~3 hours of compute"
    psychology: "Users think they get servers, actually get compute minutes"

  key_assumptions:
    - "Most users run agents for short tasks (minutes, not hours)"
    - "Significant oversubscription - most quota goes unused"
    - "Dynamic spin-up/delete to minimize costs"
    - "Arbitrage between perception and actual compute usage"

# Technical Implementation
technical_approach:
  likely_infrastructure:
    orchestration: "Container-based multi-tenancy on Hetzner servers"
    provisioning: "API-driven server spin-up/delete via Hetzner CLI"
    billing: "Track exact usage time per user"
    queue_system: "Potential wait times during high demand"

  cost_optimization:
    - "Use cheapest ARM servers (cax11) when possible"
    - "Immediate server deletion when tasks complete"
    - "Pool-based resource sharing"
    - "Geographic arbitrage (nbg1 cheapest location)"

# Conclusion
conclusion:
  sustainability: "Model is profitable if usage patterns align with assumptions"
  transparency: "Marketing potentially misleading - 'agents' ≠ 'persistent servers'"
  target_market: "Users who understand they're buying compute minutes, not dedicated infrastructure"
  scalability: "Highly scalable due to minimal per-user marginal costs"

# CLI Commands Used for Analysis
cli_commands:
  hetzner_pricing_query:
    - "hcloud server-type list | sort -k6 -n | head -20"
    - "hcloud server-type describe cax11 --output json | jq '.prices[] | select(.location == \"nbg1\")'"
    - "hcloud server-type describe cpx11 --output json | jq '.prices[] | select(.location == \"nbg1\")'"
    - "hcloud server-type describe cx22 --output json | jq '.prices[] | select(.location == \"nbg1\")'"

# Mathematical Formulas Used
formulas:
  cost_calculations:
    monthly_hours_from_budget: "budget_amount ÷ hourly_rate = total_hours"
    example: "€4.99 ÷ €0.0053 = 942 hours"

    hours_per_agent_time_sharing: "total_hours ÷ number_of_agents = hours_per_agent"
    example: "942 hours ÷ 300 agents = 3.14 hours per agent"

    daily_usage_from_monthly: "monthly_hours_per_agent ÷ 30_days = daily_hours"
    example: "3.14 ÷ 30 = 0.105 hours = 6.3 minutes per day"

    cost_per_session: "session_duration_hours × hourly_rate = cost"
    example: "0.5 hours × €0.0053 = €0.00265"

    profit_margin_per_user: "revenue - (usage_hours × hourly_rate) = profit"
    example: "€4.99 - (150 × €0.0052) = €4.21"

    profit_percentage: "(profit ÷ revenue) × 100 = profit_margin_%"
    example: "(€4.21 ÷ €4.99) × 100 = 84.4%"

  persistent_server_costs:
    monthly_cost_per_user: "number_of_agents × server_monthly_cost = total_cost"
    free_tier_loss: "30 × €3.29 = €98.70/month"
    max_tier_loss: "(300 × €3.29) - €4.99 = €982.01/month"
    ultra_tier_loss: "(3,000 × €3.29) - €45 = €9,825/month"

  calculation_commands:
    - "echo \"4.5 / 0.0052\" | bc"    # Calculate hours from budget
    - "echo \"4.5 / 0.0053\" | bc"    # Calculate hours from budget (ARM)
    - "echo \"849 / 300\" | bc"       # Calculate hours per agent (time-sharing)

notes:
  - "Analysis assumes standard Hetzner pricing without special enterprise discounts"
  - "Real costs may vary based on actual usage patterns and infrastructure efficiency"
  - "Model similar to cloud reselling with better packaging"
  - "All pricing data retrieved via Hetzner CLI (hcloud) and confirmed via jq JSON parsing"

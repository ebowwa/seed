- DO NOT MAKE YOUR OWN PLANS OR JUMP TO ADDITIONAL NON CONFIRMED SHIT AND ACTIONS

## Estimation Guidelines

When documenting tasks or effort estimates, **use complexity levels instead of time estimates**:

| Time Estimate | Complexity |
|---------------|------------|
| ~30 min | Simple |
| ~1 hour | Medium |
| Longer/multi-step | Complex |

**Why:** Time estimates are usually guesses and create false expectations. Complexity is more meaningful for planning and prioritization.

- Web Search DOESNT WORK, we need to use the `web-search-prime` MCP instead for web searching
- Doppler is the manager of secrets
- Follow Commands closely to the instruction and if unclear then ask, if have further suggestions then ask do not implement
- we are a quick cracked world class studio, we are expected of high quality solutions, interfaces, and services.
- We encourage thorough review and discourage assumptions and not overly reading the current handling
- NEVER create new files without seeing if we have it already and can be iterated on

# Cost Analysis Scenarios

  persistent_agents_per_server:
    description: "If each agent = 1 dedicated server 24/7"
    findings:
      free_tier_loss: "€98.70/month per user (30 × €3.29)"
      max_tier_loss: "€982.01/month per user (300 × €3.29 - €4.99)"
      ultra_tier_loss: "€9,825/month per user (3,000 × €3.29 - €45)"
    conclusion: "Completely unsustainable model"

  time_sharing_model:
    description: "Pooling resources where agents share compute time"
    calculations:
      max_plan_budget: "€4.99 = ~950 hours of compute"
      agents_share: "300 agents ÷ 950 hours = ~3.2 hours per agent per month"
      daily_usage: "~6 minutes per day per agent"
    conclusion: "More plausible but misleading marketing"

        echo "4.5 / 0.0053" | bc = 849 hours
        echo "849 / 300" | bc = 2.83 hours per agent
      server_specs: |
        cax11 ARM: 2 cores, 4GB RAM, 40GB SSD, €3.29/month
        cx22 x86: 2 cores, 4GB RAM, 40GB SSD, €3.29/month
        cpx11 x86: 2 cores, 2GB RAM, 40GB SSD, €3.85/month

    hard_math_calculations:
      ariana_pricing_vs_hetzner: |
        Ariana Max Plan: €4.99/month
        Compute hours available: €4.99 ÷ €0.0052 = 959.6 hours
        Per agent allocation: 959.6 ÷ 300 = 3.20 hours per agent
        Daily average: 3.20 ÷ 30 = 0.107 hours = 6.4 minutes per day

      cost_per_session: |
        30 min session: 0.5 × €0.0052 = €0.0026
        60 min session: 1.0 × €0.0052 = €0.0052
        8 hour workday: 8.0 × €0.0052 = €0.0416
        24 hour continuous: 24.0 × €0.0052 = €0.1248

      profit_margins_by_usage: |
        1 hour usage: €4.99 - €0.0052 = €4.98 profit (99.9% margin)
        10 hours usage: €4.99 - €0.052 = €4.94 profit (98.9% margin)
        50 hours usage: €4.99 - €0.26 = €4.73 profit (94.8% margin)
        100 hours usage: €4.99 - €0.52 = €4.47 profit (89.6% margin)
        460 hours usage: €4.99 - €2.39 = €2.60 profit (52.1% margin)
        960 hours usage: €4.99 - €4.99 = €0.00 profit (0% margin)

      breakeven_analysis: |
        Breakeven point: €4.99 ÷ €0.0052 = 959.6 hours
        Daily breakeven: 959.6 ÷ 30 = 32 hours per day
        If users average >32 hours/day, Ariana loses money

      oversubscription_mathematics: |
        1000 users × 300 agents = 300,000 agent launches
        If each averages 15 minutes: 300,000 × 0.25 = 75,000 hours needed
        Actual server hours sold: 1000 × 959.6 = 959,600 hours
        Oversubscription ratio: 959,600 ÷ 75,000 = 12.8x

      comparison_with_standard_vps: |
        Standard VPS provider: $5/month = 744 hours (1 server)
        Ariana Max Plan: €4.99 = 959 hours (shared across 300 "agents")
        Efficiency gain: 959 ÷ 744 = 1.29x more compute hours per dollar

    assumptions:
      average_session: "30-60 minutes per agent task"
      cost_per_session: "€0.0026-0.006 (essentially negligible)"
      typical_usage: "Most users won't utilize full quota"
      oversubscription_ratio: "10:1 to 50:1 depending on user behavior"
      session_frequency: "Most users run agents sporadically, not continuously"

    technical_implementation:
      server_lifecycle: |
        User requests agent → Spin up Hetzner server → Run task →
        Immediate deletion → Bill exact minutes used
      resource_pooling: "Multiple users share same physical servers over time"
      cost_optimization: "Use cheapest ARM servers (cax11) by default"
      queue_management: "Potential wait times during peak demand"

    profit_calculation:
      max_plan_example:
        budget: "€4.99/month = 950 hours compute"
        if_150h_used: "150 × €0.0052 = €0.78 cost"
        profit_margin: "84% (€4.21 profit per user)"
        breakeven_point: "~46 hours usage per month makes €4.99 break even"

    behavioral_analysis:
      user_psychology: |
        Users see "300 agents" and think infrastructure, not compute minutes
        Similar to "unlimited hosting" that actually has limits
        Marketing leverages server ownership language for time-sharing service

      usage_patterns:
        casual_users: "<5 hours/month (6x profit margin)"
        moderate_users: "20-50 hours/month (2-10x profit margin)"
        heavy_users: ">100 hours/month (still profitable at scale)"
        power_users: "Target for upsell to Ultra tier or enterprise plans"

    conclusion: "Most likely business model - highly profitable if usage assumptions hold"

# Realistic Cost Examples
usage_examples:
  "30 minute coding session": "€0.0026 (cax11) to €0.0036 (cpx11)"
  "1 hour debugging": "€0.0052 to €0.0072"
  "8 hour workday": "€0.04 to €0.06"
  "24 hour continuous": "€0.12 to €0.17"

# Business Model Insights
business_model:
  marketing_vs_reality:
    perceived: "300 persistent agents running simultaneously"
    actual: "300 agent launches totaling ~3 hours of compute"
    psychology: "Users think they get servers, actually get compute minutes"

  key_assumptions:
    - "Most users run agents for short tasks (minutes, not hours)"
    - "Significant oversubscription - most quota goes unused"
    - "Dynamic spin-up/delete to minimize costs"
    - "Arbitrage between perception and actual compute usage"

# Technical Implementation
technical_approach:
  likely_infrastructure:
    orchestration: "Container-based multi-tenancy on Hetzner servers"
    provisioning: "API-driven server spin-up/delete via Hetzner CLI"
    billing: "Track exact usage time per user"
    queue_system: "Potential wait times during high demand"

  cost_optimization:
    - "Use cheapest ARM servers (cax11) when possible"
    - "Immediate server deletion when tasks complete"
    - "Pool-based resource sharing"
    - "Geographic arbitrage (nbg1 cheapest location)"

# Conclusion
conclusion:
  sustainability: "Model is profitable if usage patterns align with assumptions"
  transparency: "Marketing potentially misleading - 'agents' ≠ 'persistent servers'"
  target_market: "Users who understand they're buying compute minutes, not dedicated infrastructure"
  scalability: "Highly scalable due to minimal per-user marginal costs"

# CLI Commands Used for Analysis
cli_commands:
  hetzner_pricing_query:
    - "hcloud server-type list | sort -k6 -n | head -20"
    - "hcloud server-type describe cax11 --output json | jq '.prices[] | select(.location == \"nbg1\")'"
    - "hcloud server-type describe cpx11 --output json | jq '.prices[] | select(.location == \"nbg1\")'"

# Mathematical Formulas Used
formulas:
  cost_calculations:
    monthly_hours_from_budget: "budget_amount ÷ hourly_rate = total_hours"
    example: "€4.99 ÷ €0.0053 = 942 hours"

    hours_per_agent_time_sharing: "total_hours ÷ number_of_agents = hours_per_agent"
    example: "942 hours ÷ 300 agents = 3.14 hours per agent"

    daily_usage_from_monthly: "monthly_hours_per_agent ÷ 30_days = daily_hours"
    example: "3.14 ÷ 30 = 0.105 hours = 6.3 minutes per day"

    cost_per_session: "session_duration_hours × hourly_rate = cost"
    example: "0.5 hours × €0.0053 = €0.00265"

    profit_margin_per_user: "revenue - (usage_hours × hourly_rate) = profit"
    example: "€4.99 - (150 × €0.0052) = €4.21"

    profit_percentage: "(profit ÷ revenue) × 100 = profit_margin_%"
    example: "(€4.21 ÷ €4.99) × 100 = 84.4%"

  persistent_server_costs:
    monthly_cost_per_user: "number_of_agents × server_monthly_cost = total_cost"
    free_tier_loss: "30 × €3.29 = €98.70/month"
    max_tier_loss: "(300 × €3.29) - €4.99 = €982.01/month"
    ultra_tier_loss: "(3,000 × €3.29) - €45 = €9,825/month"

  calculation_commands:
    - "echo \"4.5 / 0.0052\" | bc"    # Calculate hours from budget
    - "echo \"4.5 / 0.0053\" | bc"    # Calculate hours from budget (ARM)
    - "echo \"849 / 300\" | bc"       # Calculate hours per agent (time-sharing)

notes:
  - "Analysis assumes standard Hetzner pricing without special enterprise discounts"
  - "Real costs may vary based on actual usage patterns and infrastructure efficiency"
  - "Model similar to cloud reselling with better packaging"
  - "All pricing data retrieved via Hetzner CLI (hcloud) and confirmed via jq JSON parsing"
